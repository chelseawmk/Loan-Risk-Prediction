# Loan-Risk-Prediction

This project aims to use machine learning techniques to accurately predict the
default rate of an individual borrower. In the real business world, a rather accurate prediction
will benefit stakeholders since they can better assess early-stage loan performance on historical
data, conduct contribution analysis to identify risky segments, and measure credit expansion
opportunities.

### **Prediction Model**

Build Logistic Model, ANN, Random Forest, XGBoost for model selection and comparison. 

### **Recommendations**

Borrower from Loan with lower risks are long term employer with less delinquencies,inquiries who possess good credit history.
